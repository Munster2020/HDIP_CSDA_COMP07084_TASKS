### Task 1

Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A','A','B','C','A'] should have output {'A': 3,'B': 1,'C': 1}.

Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research he task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.

Addendum: We were also asked to see if we could create a solution that could could use not just strings in the input but also integers or floats.

Clarification: You cannot use any part of the standard library that has to be imported. The Python documentation technically includes the built-in, non-language features in the standard library - even though they do not need to be imported: https://docs.python.org/3/library/. You can use any of these built-in features - just not anything you need to import.
