    "Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values.  So, the input ['A','A','B','C','A'] should have output {'A': 3,'B': 1,'C': 1}.  Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise.   You should research he task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.\n"

    "A function in Python is defined using the `def` keyword. A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. In this function it is called `counts`. Information can be passed into functions as arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma. In this function we have one argument called `(my_list)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also creates a dictionary called `freq`. A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values. It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n",
